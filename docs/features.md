## Features
### Simulates weight on musclces
This is the main function of this project is to provide some sort of feedback when using muscles in VR that enhances the immersion and experience. The intention is not to simulate the exact weight of an object in the VR environment, rather to simulate the feeling of weight or resistance in a positive way.

### Wireless integration and connection with VR applications
The device connects through WiFi with a simple protocol that allows any Wifi connected machine to control the device. This avoids another tether and could also be combined VR headsets like the Oculus Quest 2 to provide a completely wireless VR experience.

### Lightweight and not bulky
The device is very lightweight and using it doesn't hurt the VR experience with a large item like a vest or a glove that affects mobility.

### Adjustable intensity to avoid discomfort
The intensity of the muscle stimulation is adjustable across a wide range of parameters to allow the user to stay comfortable. One item of concern is that muscle stimuation can increase over time as moisture builds up underneath the electrodes. The adjustable parameters allow any increase in stimulation to be compensated for to keep a comportable and immersive VR experience.

# Enhancing the VR Experience with Weight - CS 6360 Final Project
Bryan Hatasaka | December 2021

## About
This is the landing page for my CS 6360 final project. This project is a device that can be attached to a user and allows "weight" to be felt in VR. It is powered from any USB battery bank and connects to VR applications over WiFi. Power consumption is low and intensity is adjustable. An extremely basic Unity application can be used to demo this effect. See details below!

## Pitch
This project is about a device that uses neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) to stimulate muscles and simulate weight while in VR environments. This is unlike other products such as the [Tesla Suit](https://teslasuit.io/) or [Haptx](https://haptx.com/) that use haptic feedback and mechanical devices to simulate forces. NMES provides a lightweight, energy efficient solution that actually uses your muscles themselves to provide the forcess needed for weight.

## History
### Origins
Back in 2018, I joined a startup created by my friends with the intention of creating a product to allow a user to feel weight in VR. Shortly before I joined, they came up with and breifly tested NMES (among other methods) as a method of simulating weight. We found that it would potentially work for larger muscles and limbs. My role was to design the NMES circuitry that allowed stimulation of muscles. I also worked on design of the Unity application that we used to demo the product. That company was dissolved in 2018 and no code, hardware, or schematics from that experience were used.

### Inspiration
When using VR for the first time, one of the most noticable apect missing for me is resistance while picking up or throwing items. Products such as haptic vests and mechanical VR gloves are extremely interesting to me and I feel as though they would really complete the home VR experience. I have always been interested in that product that we created and now, a few years later I still haven't seen any other products that use the same technology. I think that there is potential in this technology for VR and that it is fun to explore.

### Why This Project?
After my time at the startup ended, I learned a great deal more about embedded systems and circuit design. When I found out we were doing projects, I was reminded of my time at the startup and the product we designed. I was very interested in tacking a simplified version of the whole project where I could design the embedded systems aspects with the knowledge and tools that I've learned about since leaving. In addition, I think that this project is unique in that it is mainly a hardware project with firmware development, and not just a software application.

### Why now?
Because I haven't seen NMES technology used in any consumer VR products, I think that this is a good time to explore the potential of this technology. In addition, I think that I am in a good spot in my knowledge to be able to tackle this project and solve the problems that come along with the nature of the project.

## Features
### Simulates weight on musclces
This is the main function of this project is to provide some sort of feedback when using muscles in VR that enhances the immersion and experience. The intention is not to simulate the exact weight of an object in the VR environment, rather to simulate the feeling of weight or resistance in a positive way.

### Wireless integration and connection with VR applications
The device connects through WiFi with a simple protocol that allows any Wifi connected machine to control the device. This avoids another tether and could also be combined VR headsets like the Oculus Quest 2 to provide a completely wireless VR experience.

### Lightweight and not bulky
The device is very lightweight and using it doesn't hurt the VR experience with a large item like a vest or a glove that affects mobility.

### Adjustable intensity to avoid discomfort
The intensity of the muscle stimulation is adjustable across a wide range of parameters to allow the user to stay comfortable. One item of concern is that muscle stimuation can increase over time as moisture builds up underneath the electrodes. The adjustable parameters allow any increase in stimulation to be compensated for to keep a comportable and immersive VR experience.

## About
### The Development Team
I, Bryan, am the sole member of my team. I came to enroll in the class through my roomate - he went to the first class and gave it a raving review so I decided to drop one of the other classes that I was enrolled and less interested it, and enrolled in Virtual Reality. This is my last semester at the University of Utah so I wanted to take a fun class that could provide a unique and fun experience.

Because I am the only member of my teams, I did all of the work. However, I do have some experience from my friends' startup which gave me a boost in engineering the NMES circuitry. As stated before, no code, hardware, nor schematics from the company were used in the design and implementation of this project.

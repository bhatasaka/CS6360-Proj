# Enhancing the VR Experience with Weight - CS 6360 Final Project
Bryan Hatasaka | December 2021

## About
This is the repository for my CS 6360 final project. This project is a device that can be attached to a user and allows "weight" to be felt in VR. It is powered from any USB battery bank and connects to VR applications over WiFi. Power consumption is low and intensity is adjustable. An extremely basic Unity application can be used to demo this effect. See details here: [cs6360.hatasaka.com](https://cs6360.hatasaka.com/)
